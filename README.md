# Solana Season Hackathon ¬∑ Media Foundation

## About The Project

Media Network is a new protocol that bypasses traditional CDN providers‚Äô centralized approach for an open-source solution where everyone can participate. 

## Media Foundation Vision

We are building Media Network, a peer-to-peer Content Delivery Network, available [here](https://app.media.network). $MEDIA token-holders can add resources to the network right away and start delivering their websites or applications using the CDN. We're partnering with the Solana Foundation and joining this great #SolanaSZN hackathon to encourage developers and entrepreneurs to join us and start building exciting new stuff!

## $30,000 in prizes

The Media Foundation will offer $30,000 in prizes and the ability to qualify for potential further funding from our [grant programs](https://gov.media.network/c/come-here-to-apply-for-a-gran-from-the-media-foundation/5) to successful submissions. Future funding will be provided at the Foundation's discretion, depending on the potential of each project.


The leading project will win $15,000. In addition, up to 3 other teams could win additional ‚ÄúBest of‚Äù prizes focused on:

 1. The Best UX/UI
 2. Code Completion / Completed Logic Model
 3. Biggest Market Potential


Winners will be chosen based on evaluation by a panel of judges with expertise in crypto-based user experiences.

## Guidelines

We will award projects that integrate Media Network. All projects will have to provide an MVP (minimum viable product). We will gladly add the resources for teams that don‚Äôt hold enough MEDIA. Ask for that in our [Developer Chat](https://discord.com/invite/wwSw3J7F2j)

### Possible Ideas

These ideas/apps will have to use Media Network as the primary CDN. The [Media PeerPool](https:/github.com/mediafoundation) SDK reduces CDN consumption up to 99% and will also have to be included for on-demand and live streaming media projects.

1. Live streaming platform, including chat, a reward system (for content creators and viewers), and ideally a real-time betting system with $MEDIA integration.
2. On-demand video platform with SPL wallet integration and incentivized subscription/consumption models.
3. Podcast hosting, indexing, and distribution. Optional subscription models with $MEDIA integration.
4. Video-conference app/website with SPL wallet integration.

Note: You can build anything you'd like, even if it isn't on this list üôÇ

Entrants are encouraged to be creative and fork open source projects like [Media Server](https://github.com/mediafoundation/mediaserver/).

## Private Discord

Teams will be able to join a new channel (with their project name on it) on our [developer discord](https://discord.com/invite/wwSw3J7F2j) once the MVP is live. This chat will be private between the project's developers and Media Foundation Devs to assist them on the integration. You can ask for this creating an issue in this repo.
